# Switcheroo - A simple colorscheme switcher
This plugin allows to switch your colorscheme and make a quick preview with a code snippet.
What differentiates this plugin from other is that it sources every month the colorschemes on [Awesome-neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim)

## Dependecies

- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)

- [Plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) for async.

## Usage

Ever wanted to try new colorschemes but the search, clone, install and update cycle is too boring?

Now you can open the Preview Window with `:Switcheroo` and see the list of the colorschemes avaiable for you and hot reload the colorscheme with a code snippet preview. Then you can select by pressing `<Enter>`

By default the plugin is showing only with the already installed in your computer. You can add `dotfyle = { "top", "new" }` on your configurantion to add top and new lists.(NOT IMPLMENTED)

## Known Issues

- Some of the colorschemes don't correctly load. I'm trying to figure out how to do it.
